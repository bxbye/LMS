Certainly! Here's a project homework idea that allows you to practice OOP concepts in Python:

Project: Library Management System

Description:
Create a Library Management System that allows users to manage books, borrowers, and library transactions. The system should support functionalities such as adding books to the library, lending books to borrowers, returning books, and displaying the status of books and borrowers.

Requirements:

Implement three classes: Book, Borrower, and Library.

The Book class should have attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and availability. It should provide methods to display book details and update the availability status.

The Borrower class should have attributes such as name, borrowed_books, and fine_amount. It should provide methods to display borrower details, borrow books, return books, and calculate fines.

The Library class should manage the collection of books and borrowers. It should provide methods to add books to the library, register borrowers, lend books, and return books. It should also include functionality to display the status of books and borrowers.

Implement appropriate error handling for scenarios such as borrowing an unavailable book or returning a book that was not borrowed.

Create a menu-driven interface that allows users to interact with the Library Management System. The menu should include options to add books, register borrowers, lend books, return books, display book status, display borrower status, and exit the program.

Ensure proper encapsulation and abstraction by using appropriate access modifiers and separating concerns into different classes and methods.

Test your implementation by creating instances of the classes and performing various operations such as adding books, lending books, returning books, and displaying status.

Remember to plan and design your classes and their interactions before starting the implementation. Break down the problem into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one.

This project will give you the opportunity to practice OOP principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It will also allow you to work on class interactions, error handling, and user interface design.
